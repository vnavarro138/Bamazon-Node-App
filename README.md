# Bamazon-Node-App
Using MySQL database to keep inventory for items available for sale

The Bamazon Node App is an Amazon-like storefront that allows a user to make an order and then uses MySQL to track the store's inventory.
This project is useful since inventory management is automated.

To get started, run the app by typing <node bamazon.js> in your command terminal, then you will be prompted for a selection. 
  
You will be asked the ID of the product you would like to buy, then you will be asked for the quantity of the product you would like to buy. Once you place an order, you will be told if there is sufficient inventory. If there is, you will be given the total cost of your purchase.
